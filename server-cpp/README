1. Run configure.py (needs Python 3.4+). You can set CXX environment variable to change the compiler executable used
(by default clang++-3.8). E.g. with bash:

    CXX=g++ ./configure.py

With cmd:

    set CXX=g++
    py configure.py

With PowerShell:

    $env:CXX = 'g++'
    py configure.py

2. Run ninja (recommended 1.6 but older should work too).
To clean run `ninja -t clean`.

Server will be built into bin/tatsoryk-server. By default it listens on 127.0.0.1:8080.
