1. Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org with npm (both LTS and Stable will suffice).
2. Install GNU make version 3.81 at least.
3. Running GNU make in client root will install dependencies and build the client. With tyeps.

If npm fails on Vagrant VM with a message containing "symlink", that means you need to run make install from your host OS (after make clean-install, of course). This is a known (and unfixed) issue.

If you're not in the contributors section in package.json and bower.json, add yourself there if you commit any code.
